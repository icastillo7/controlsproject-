Introduction

For our project we have built a hoist winch with feedback control. This can be useful if a steady angular velocity from the winch is desired. As more load is applied, more voltage is required to maintain the angular velocity of the winch.

Figure 1 illustrates the physical system in top view and side view. The system consists of a main support beam, two support bearings and a shaft, and the spool. Torque is applied to the shaft and spool from a motor and the angular velocity is monitored by a tachometer.
